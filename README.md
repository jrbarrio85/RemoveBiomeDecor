-Initial upload

Tired of running into obtrusive biome d√©cor in your vehicle? Or just tired of seeing so many small dead trees with poor LOD?

Stops the following from spawning in biomes:

-small dead shrubs
-cinderblocks
-driftwood
-scrap metal piles

NOTE: New save required for this to fully take effect. Not doing so means the mod will only work in chunks that have not been loaded yet (you haven't been there).

NOTE: Does not affect said decorations from spawning in POIs
